# SAP_ABAP_Project
SAP ABAP project for HRMS Functional Module in which complete life cycle of Employee in an organisation is carried out.

Summary of the Project:
An HR will add the employee to the database which is called on-boarding of an employee. Once an Employee is onboarded, then is eligible to apply leave, cancel leave or update his profile.

When an employee applies for a leave, the request will go to their manager and its on manager to either approve or reject the leave request. If the request is approved the leave count is reduced. Also the employee cannot apply for the same tenure if the leave is laready approved. Similarly an employee can cancel the leave request as well. Along with leave portal , an employee can also update their profile with change in email address or Phone number.
A Manager has the authority to approve the leave request for the employee under them. Also they can raise a request to promote an employee from their current designation to a higher one.
And at last an employee can resign from the company. Once resigned their resignation request will go to the manager for their approval and once manager approves the resignation request it will go further to HR for their approval and after HR approves the resignation request employee is not allowed to login in the portal again.
